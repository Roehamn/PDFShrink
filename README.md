# PDFShrink
My attempt at creating an interface that uses ghostscript/qpdf/orcmypdf to shrink down and maybe do other stuff to pdfs. 



Honestly this is only possible with chatgpt holding my hand pretty hard, but I really want to make this because for some reason it's impossible to find a decent tool to shrink a pdf that isn't locked behind a paywall
pdf's are simple. I don't believe it should cost money to do a simple task like shrink.   



maybe later I'll try do like a reorder page thing
we'll see, maybe I can't even do this ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
