# PDFShrink
My attempt at creating an interface that uses ghostscript/qpdf/orcmypdf to shrink down and maybe do other stuff to pdfs. 



Honestly this is only possible with chatgpt holding my hand pretty hard, but I really want to make this because for some reason it's impossible to find a decent tool to shrink a pdf that isn't locked behind a paywall and/or the app is needlessly complex   



What I'd like to add:


-Windows compatibility/release

-Better dependency checks

-Auto updater

-Reorder pdf pages

-merge pdfs

-is upscale possible? hmmm....

-python alternative? (I'm probably too dumb for anything else, so why not java?)
