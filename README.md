# PDFShrink
Never Done this before
but I'm gonna try make an app that uses ghostscript/qpdf/orcmypdf to shrink down and maybe do other stuff to pdfs. 

I'm only maybe going to be able to do this with chatgpt holding my hand pretty hard, but I really want to do this because for some reason it's impossible to find a decent tool to shrink a pdf that isn't locked behind a paywall
pdf's are simple. I don't believe it should cost money to do a simple task like shrink


maybe later I'll try do like a reorder thing
we'll see, maybe I can't even do this ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
